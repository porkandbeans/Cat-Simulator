# Terminal-based Cat Simulator 2021
terminal-based cat simulator for linux (but you can port it to windows if you really wanted to)

Extreme cat action!

Pet the cat!

Scan your computer for viruses (and add cat-based improvements to your operating system)!

Oven!

There is literally nothing this cat simulator cannot do. Except help you find true love. But I mean this comes pretty close.

# Installation
Don't. Download "main" (not main.cpp, that's source code) and execute it in a terminal emulator of your choice
$./main
