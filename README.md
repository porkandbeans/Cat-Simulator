# Terminal-based Cat Simulator 2021
terminal-based cat simulator for linux (but you can port it to windows if you really wanted to)

Extreme cat action!

Pet the cat!

Scan your computer for viruses (and add cat-based improvements to your operating system)!

Oven!

There is literally nothing this cat simulator cannot do. Except help you find true love. But I mean this comes pretty close.

# How make cat on my computer?
```
git clone https://github.com/porkandbeans/Cat-Simulator/
cd Cat-Simulator
./main
```
# Real cats
- smelly
- ugly
- open door and make cold
- food expensive
- die

# My program
- no smell
- not possible to be ugly
- cannot even comprehend what door be
- food free
- never die


# Why did you make this?
too much free time
